# Why use Futures?

There are two types of tasks when writing software. Synchronous and Asynchronous and you ALWAYS need to use both. Futures are used for asynchronous tasks. Lets look at an example of both. In the code on the right we have 2 functions. 

1. `calculateSum`: This function takes in 2 values and returns the sum of those two values
2. `getWeather`: This function contains a long running task and has to wait for that to complete before returning our expected result.

The first funcion is synchronous, this means that the code will only continue to execute when this function is complete. Put the code below into the main function and run it.

```dart
int a = 1, b =2;
int sum = calculateSum(a, b);
print('sum: $sum');
```

The program would complete the execution of each step before continuing on to the next line of code. If you click on the console tab under the code you'll see logs like below.

```txt
sum calculated
sum: 3
```

This is synchronous. Each line completes before moving to the next. Now lets look at the `getWeather` function. It uses a type `Future`, How do we write code for that? The answer is ... Not like the code above ðŸ¤¯ If we do write it the same way, some strange things happen. Update your code in the main function to the code below.

```dart
String location = 'Cape Town';
final weather = getWeather(location);
print('weather: $weather');
```

If you run this code you'll see that the console output look a bit weird. 

```txt
Fetching weather ...
weather: Instance of 'Future<double>'
weather retrieved
```

The first thing to notice is `Instance of Future<double>`, we returned 30 and it's not printed out anywhere. The second and more important thing to notice is Weather retrieved printed out after the `print('weather: $weather');` statement but the function was called before it.
