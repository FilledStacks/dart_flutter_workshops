# What is a Future?

There are two types of tasks when writing software: synchronous and asynchronous. Futures are used for asynchronous tasks. Lets look at an example of both. In the code on the right there are 2 functions. 

1. `calculateSum`: This function takes in 2 values and returns the sum of those two values
2. `getWeather`: This function contains a long running task and has to wait for that to complete before returning the expected result.

The first funcion is synchronous, this means that the code will only continue to execute when this function is complete. 

<!-- Two headings with exactly the same content was a little confusing. I added a little more to each "Your Turn" heading to make it clearer to me what each section covers -->
## Your turn: Synchronous Functions

In `main`, call `calculateSum` and print out the result. Note: Results are printed to the "Console" panel.

---

Run this code and you'll see the program will complete the execution of each step before continuing on to the next line of code. If you click on the console tab under the code you'll see logs like below.

```
sum calculated
sum: 3
```

This is a *synchronous* task. Each line of code completes before moving to the next. Now, lets look at the `getWeather()` function. It has the type `Future`, How do you get an actual value from this function? The answer is ... Not like the code above ðŸ¤¯ 

## Your Turn: Asynchronous Functions

For this example, lets just write it the wrong way ðŸ™ˆ Under the code you added above call the `getWeather` future and print out the response similar to above. 

---

If you run this code (and you did it the wrong way ðŸ˜‰) you'll see that the console output looks a bit weird. You'll see an additional 3 log outputs.

```
Fetching weather ...
weather: Instance of 'Future<double>'
weather retrieved
```

<!-- where is this "weather: $weather" statement? Ah -- it's in the solution. I might avoid this part of the explanation, or not assume the readers solution is exactly the same as yours. My solution did not introduce a variable called "weather", I just did `print(getWeather('Berlin'));` -->
In contrast to `calculateSum`, this is an *asynchronous* task. The first difference you may notice is that the function returns `30`, but it's not printed out anywhere. Instead, it prints `Instance of Future<double>`. The second and more important thing to notice is `"weather retrieved"` printed out after the `"weather: $weather"` statement but the function was called before it.
